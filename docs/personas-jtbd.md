## 3. Onboarding Flow (First Run Experience)

When a user installs openTrattOS for the first time (self-hosted) or signs up 
(TrattOS Enterprise), the system guides them through a 5-step wizard:

### Step 1: Create Organization
- Organization name (e.g. "Grupo Palafito")
- Base currency (EUR, USD, GBP, MXN...) — **set once, immutable**
- Default language (es, en, fr, pt, it, de)
- Timezone

### Step 2: Create First Location (Venue)
- Location name (e.g. "Palafito Madrid Centro")
- Address
- Type: Restaurant | Bar | Dark Kitchen | Catering | Central Production

### Step 3: Choose Category Taxonomy
- **Use default taxonomy** (pre-seeded, translated to selected language)
- **Start empty** (power users who will build their own)
- **Import from CSV/Excel** (restaurants migrating from spreadsheets)

### Step 4: Create Admin User
- Name, email, password
- Automatically assigned `OWNER` role on the organization

### Step 5: Quick Win — Add Your First Ingredient
- Guided walkthrough: create 1 ingredient + 1 supplier + 1 price
- Shows the auto-calculated "cost per gram" immediately
- Celebration animation 🎉 (engagement hook)

After onboarding, the user lands on an **empty-state Dashboard** with clear CTAs:
- "Add 10 ingredients to unlock your first recipe"
- "Invite your Head Chef"
- "Connect a supplier"
