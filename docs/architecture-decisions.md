# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

**Project:** openTrattOS  
**Status:** Approved by Product Owner  
**Date:** 2026-04-19

---

## ADR-001: Modular Monolith with DDD over Microservices

**Decision:** The backend is a single NestJS process organized as a Modular Monolith 
following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Bounded Contexts.

**Rationale:** True microservices impose unsustainable operational complexity for an 
early-stage Open Source project. DDD Bounded Contexts provide clear module boundaries 
that can be extracted into independent services later without architectural rewrites.

**Consequence:** Every module (ingredients, costing, haccp, operations) is fully 
self-contained. Cross-module communication happens via published interfaces, never 
direct entity imports.

---

## ADR-002: API-First Design for MCP Agent Compatibility

**Decision:** All API endpoints must be atomic, semantically named, and fully 
documented in OpenAPI/Swagger from day one.

**Rationale:** In TrattOS Enterprise, the API will be wrapped as MCP (Model Context 
Protocol) Tools to be consumed by AI agents (Hermes/OpenClaw). An agent LLM must be 
able to understand what a tool does from its name and description alone, without 
reading documentation.

**Rules enforced:**
- No generic route names (no /process, /handle, /do)
- Every endpoint has a Swagger @ApiOperation summary and description
- Request and Response DTOs are always explicitly typed (never `any`)
- Pagination is consistent across all list endpoints (cursor-based)

---

## ADR-003: AI Layer is Optional and Isolated

**Decision:** The Python FastAPI AI microservice is a separate process. The NestJS 
API only calls it if `AI_SERVICE_URL` is set in environment variables.

**Rationale:** openTrattOS Community Edition must work 100% offline and without AI 
costs. The AI layer is a TrattOS Enterprise differentiator.

---

## ADR-004: Multi-Tenant Architecture from Day One

**Decision:** All primary database tables include `organizationId` as a required 
non-nullable foreign key.

**Rationale:** A single restaurateur uses 1 organization. A group with 5 venues uses 
1 organization with 5 Locations. This enables TrattOS Enterprise's multi-venue 
management without schema migrations later.

---

## ADR-005: TrattOS Enterprise Agent Stack (Reserved)

**Decision:** The following components are out of scope for openTrattOS Community and 
are reserved for TrattOS Enterprise:

- **Agent Runtime:** Hermes / OpenClaw
- **Memory Layer:** Hindsight
- **Messaging Interface:** WhatsApp / Telegram bridge for kitchen staff
- **Orchestration:** LangGraph workflows
- **Infrastructure:** Deployed and managed via Rancher (Kubernetes)

**Rationale:** These components require permanent cloud infrastructure, secrets 
management, and SLA guarantees incompatible with a self-hosted Open Source project.

---

## ADR-006: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Decision:** The system implements a three-tier role model: `OWNER`, `MANAGER`, `STAFF`. 
Roles are assigned per-user at the organization level.

**Rationale:** A kitchen has three clearly distinct user archetypes with wildly 
different needs and trust levels. Owners monitor margins, Managers engineer recipes, 
Line Cooks fill checklists. Mixing permissions leads to data corruption 
(e.g. a line cook accidentally changing an ingredient price).

**Consequence:** Every protected endpoint must check the user's role via a 
NestJS guard decorator (`@Roles('OWNER', 'MANAGER')`). The full RBAC matrix is 
documented in [personas-jtbd.md](./personas-jtbd.md).

---

## ADR-007: Single Currency per Organization (V1)

**Decision:** All monetary values are stored in a single currency defined at the 
`Organization` level (`currencyCode`, ISO 4217). The currency is set during onboarding 
and is immutable.

**Rationale:** Multi-currency adds enormous complexity (exchange rates, hedging, 
invoicing mismatches). For V1, the overwhelmingly common case is: one country = 
one currency. Multi-currency will be added in a future version if demand requires it.

**Consequence:** The `unitPrice` and `costPerBaseUnit` fields on `SupplierItem` are 
always in the org's currency. The UI displays the org's currency symbol everywhere.

---

## ADR-008: Internationalization (i18n) Strategy

**Decision:** The UI supports multiple languages via JSON translation files 
(`/locales/es.json`, `/locales/en.json`). The active locale is determined by 
the organization's `defaultLocale` field. System-managed data (category seeds) 
uses dedicated translation columns (`nameEs`, `nameEn`) in the database.

**Rationale:** openTrattOS targets the Spanish and international markets. A Spanish 
chef must see "Verduras de Hoja" while an English-speaking chef sees "Leafy Greens". 
User-generated content (ingredient names, recipe descriptions) is NOT translated — 
each organization writes in their own language.

**V1 Locales:** `es`, `en`  
**Future:** Community-contributed locale files for `fr`, `pt`, `it`, `de`.

---

## ADR-009: Soft Delete with Referential Integrity

**Decision:** Primary entities use `isActive` boolean for soft delete. Physical 
deletion is never performed except on full organization teardown.

**Rationale:** Recipes, compliance logs, and cost reports hold historical references 
to ingredients and suppliers. Hard-deleting an ingredient would break every recipe 
that used it. Soft delete preserves data integrity while keeping the UI clean.

**Rules:**
- Default list queries filter by `isActive = true`.
- Historical views show deactivated items with a "Discontinued" visual badge.
- Category deletion is `RESTRICT` — cannot delete a category that has children or ingredients.
- Reactivation is available to `OWNER` and `MANAGER` roles.

# Module 2 ADRs (added 2026-04-27 post-Gate-A approval of [PRD-2](./prd-module-2-recipes.md))

## ADR-010: M2 DDD Bounded Contexts

**Decision:** Module 2 introduces 4 new bounded contexts within the modular monolith
(per ADR-001):
- **Recipes** — Recipe + RecipeIngredient + cost rollup logic + cycle detection
- **Menus** — MenuItem + margin reporting
- **Labels** — EU 1169/2011 PDF rendering engine
- **Nutritional Catalog** — Open Food Facts mirror + lookup (extends Ingredients context)

The **Inventory** context is reserved as a Module 3 boundary; M2 reaches it only through
the `InventoryCostResolver` interface (ADR-011).

**Rationale:** Per ADR-001 each capability gets its own bounded context that can be
extracted to a microservice later without rewriting clients. M2 introduces 4 new
capabilities; they map cleanly to 4 contexts.

**Consequence:**
- Each context is self-contained: own entities, repositories, services, ports.
- Cross-context calls go through published interfaces (e.g. `RecipeReader` for Menus to read Recipe data).
- Cross-context entity imports are forbidden (lint rule per ADR-013).

---

## ADR-011: InventoryCostResolver as M2→M3 architectural seam

**Decision:** Define a `InventoryCostResolver` interface in the Recipes context with a
stable signature `resolveCost(ingredientId, sourceOverrideRef?) → CostPerBaseUnit`.
Implementations:
- **M2 (this module):** `M2DefaultCostResolver` returns the `isPreferred=true`
  `SupplierItem.unitPrice` for the ingredient (or the `sourceOverrideRef` if set).
- **M3 (Inventory + Batches, future):** `M3FifoBatchResolver` returns FIFO oldest-batch
  cost, preserving the same signature.

**Rationale:** Cost resolution must be replaceable without rewriting recipe rollup code.
By committing to this seam in M2, the M3 batch implementation drops in without touching
FR9/FR14 callers. Aligns with FIFO costing used by McDonald's, Sodexo, Aramark
(HACCP-aligned physical flow == accounting flow).

**Consequence:**
- Interface contract documented at `apps/api/src/recipes/cost/InventoryCostResolver.ts`
  with semver-style stability guarantee. Breaking changes require a deprecation cycle.
- "InventoryCostResolver API-stable" Technical Success KPI tracked from M2 ship to M3 launch.
- Cycle detection (ADR-014) and cost precision (ADR-015) co-evolve with this interface.

---

## ADR-012: Open Food Facts hybrid integration (local mirror + API fallback)

**Decision:** Open Food Facts data integrates as a **hybrid**:
- **Local mirror:** Postgres table `external_food_catalog` populated from the OFF weekly
  dump (~2-4 GB compressed). Active-passive table swap for zero-downtime sync.
- **REST API fallback:** `world.openfoodfacts.org/api/v3` queried on local cache miss
  or when local data is stale (>30 days for that product). Gated by
  `OPENTRATTOS_OFF_API_FALLBACK_ENABLED` feature flag.
- **Refresh job:** Cron, weekly. Atomic schema-versioned table swap.

**Rationale:** Local mirror gives <100ms p95 lookup (NFR target), zero network dependency
in the typical case, and ODbL-compliant usage (we use the data, we don't redistribute the
DB). API fallback covers freshly-released products + cache misses without forcing a daily sync.

**Consequence:**
- New table `external_food_catalog` indexed by barcode + name + brandName for fuzzy search.
- Sync script lives in `apps/api/src/nutrition-catalog/sync/` with weekly cron schedule.
- Compliance documented in `LICENSES.md` (ODbL: usage compliant; no redistribution of derived DB).
- If OFF service is degraded: local mirror keeps working for queries; sync retries next tick.
- If OFF disappears entirely: pivot to USDA FoodData Central + CIQUAL (smaller, generic-only) — documented in PRD §Risk Mitigations.

## ADR-013: MCP-server is Community core; specific agent runtimes stay BYO/Enterprise

**Decision:** The `opentrattos` MCP server (the contract surface that any
MCP-compatible agent connects to) ships in the **Community edition**. The specific AGENT
RUNTIMES (Hermes, OpenCode, Claude Desktop, custom) and the MEMORY LAYER (Hindsight)
remain Enterprise/BYO per the unchanged parts of ADR-005.

**Rationale:** ADR-005 conflated three concerns: (a) agent runtime, (b) memory layer,
(c) MCP contract surface. Contract surfaces are cheap to ship and define the integration
point. Community openTrattOS thus offers a standard MCP server out-of-the-box; Enterprise
customers (or any DIY user) plug their preferred agent into it.

**Rules enforced:**
- The MCP server is packaged as a **separate Docker image / npm module**, independent of
  `apps/api`. Lives in `packages/mcp-server/` (new package).
- `apps/api/` source code prohibited from importing `hermes-*`, `claude-*`, `opencode-*`,
  or any agent vendor packages. Enforced by `eslint-plugin-import` `no-restricted-paths`.
- Standalone deployment mode (no MCP server, no web chat widget) is fully functional via
  UI; switching to agent-integrated mode requires only env-var changes
  (`OPENTRATTOS_AGENT_ENABLED=true`) + container restart. Target operator time: ≤30 min.
- **Dual-mode CI**: full E2E suite runs in BOTH standalone and agent-integrated
  configurations on every PR.
- The MCP server passes the official MCP protocol test suite + conformance tests against
  ≥3 distinct clients (Hermes, OpenCode, Claude Desktop, raw Python MCP SDK).

**Consequence:** ADR-005 retains its Enterprise-only scope for Hermes/OpenCode runtimes
+ Hindsight + managed WhatsApp routing. M2 superseding clarification (this ADR): the
MCP CONTRACT SURFACE is OSS Community; the AGENT and MEMORY are not.

---

## ADR-014: Cycle detection on sub-recipe save (graph walk pre-commit)

**Decision:** Every Recipe save with sub-recipe additions performs a **graph walk**
before commit:
1. Build the dependency graph from the proposed Recipe (nodes = Recipes,
   edges = "uses sub-recipe").
2. DFS from the proposed Recipe; if any traversal returns to the proposed Recipe ID →
   cycle → reject with error naming both nodes and direction.
3. Hard depth cap at **10 levels**; deeper graphs reject with "recipe graph too deep,
   refactor".

**Rationale:** Sub-recipe cycles silently corrupt cost rollup (infinite recursion or
wrong totals). Pre-commit detection is cheaper than post-commit cleanup. Depth cap
prevents pathological cases without limiting realistic kitchens (most multi-level recipes
≤4 levels).

**Consequence:**
- Save endpoint becomes ~10ms slower for sub-recipe-heavy saves (negligible vs the 500ms
  cost recalc budget).
- Error message includes both nodes (per FR6) and direction so the chef understands
  without thinking.

---

## ADR-015: Cost calculation precision (4 decimal internal, 2 display, ≤0.01% tolerance)

**Decision:** All cost math uses:
- **4 decimal places internally** (Postgres `numeric(18,4)`)
- **2 decimal places for display** (rounded half-even via `Intl.NumberFormat`)
- **Tolerance budget:** ≤0.01% accumulated rollup error across recipes with up to 5
  sub-recipe levels and 30 ingredients

Backed by **100% unit test coverage** on the cost-calculation path (recipe rollup,
sub-recipe recursion, yield × waste math, currency rounding).

**Rationale:** Per PRD §Technical Success. Sub-recipe rollups multiply percentages;
without precision discipline, drift accumulates. The 0.01% tolerance is a hard contract
that all current and future implementations must respect.

**Consequence:**
- TypeORM column type for monetary fields: `numeric(18,4)`.
- Display layer rounds via `Intl.NumberFormat` half-even.
- ATDD scenarios cover the tolerance budget against hand-calculated reference values.

---

## ADR-016: No formal Recipe lifecycle states in MVP

**Decision:** Recipe entity has NO `status`/`lifecycle`/`state` field in M2 MVP. Drafts
are implicit: any Recipe with `isActive=true` and partial fields is "in progress"; once
required fields are present, it's "complete". State management is conversational
(FR42 `missingFields`/`nextRequired` in API responses), not persisted as enum states.

**Rationale:** Per PRD §Product Scope, recipe versioning is **Growth-tier (M2.1)**.
Lifecycle states (draft / published / archived) belong with versioning since they share
the same audit and reference semantics. Adding states to MVP without versioning support
would create a half-feature that needs revisiting.

**Consequence:**
- `Recipe.isActive` boolean stays the only state field (per ADR-009 soft-delete pattern).
- API responses for incomplete Recipes include FR42 `missingFields`/`nextRequired`
  metadata so agents (Hermes etc.) know what to ask for next.
- Future M2.1 versioning ADR will introduce the state machine AND immutable version
  snapshots together.

---

## ADR-017: Full EU 1169/2011 allergen handling (supersedes PRD-1 §4.11)

**Decision:** Allergens are first-class in M2:
- Stored on Ingredient (`allergens: text[]` from OFF or manual entry)
- Aggregated to Recipe level via **conservative inference** (ANY allergen on ANY
  ingredient bubbles up; never auto-clear)
- Rendered on labels with **Article 21 emphasis** (bold + contrast)
- Ingredient list ordered by **Article 18** (descending mass)
- Chef override at Recipe level with attribution + reason (`Manager+` role required)
- Recipe-level **"may contain traces of [allergen]"** cross-contamination free-text field
- **Pre-launch external legal review** of label template

This **supersedes [PRD-1 §4.11](./prd-module-1-ingredients.md)** which deferred allergens
to M3/M4.

**Rationale:** Per scope expansion at M2 PRD discovery (Module 5 absorption). With Open
Food Facts data the allergen tagging comes for free; deferring loses the value. EU 1169/2011
is non-negotiable for restaurant compliance in EU markets.

**Consequence:**
- M3 (Inventory) and M4 (HACCP) inherit the allergen pattern from M2 rather than
  introducing it from scratch.
- M2 budget includes label template + external legal review (~1-2 weeks of effort,
  identified by month 2 of M2 build per PRD §Resource Risks).
- Allergen overrides require `Manager+` per RBAC matrix update (PRD §SaaS B2B section).

---

## ADR-018: AI yield-suggestion model — gpt-oss-20b via OpenRouter, abstracted behind interface

**Decision:**
- **Model:** `gpt-oss-20b-rag` via the existing LiteLLM proxy → OpenRouter → Groq backend
  (the same model Hindsight already uses in production).
- **Abstraction:** Wrap the call in a `YieldSuggestionModel` interface so the
  implementation can be swapped without touching `RecipeIngredient` save logic.
- **Eval gate:** Pre-launch, run a 50-ingredient evaluation against USDA FoodData Central
  + CIA Pro Chef gold values; require ≥95% within 5pp of reference. If fail, swap
  implementation behind the interface.
- **Operational override:** Env var `OPENTRATTOS_AI_YIELD_MODEL` (default
  `gpt-oss-20b-rag`) allows ops-time model swap without code change.

**Rationale:** `gpt-oss-20b` is cheapest ($0.075/1M in, $0.30/1M out), already wired
through the per-consumer key isolation (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY_RAG`), and validated in
production by Hindsight. The interface gives us A/B-testing capability post-launch
without refactor.

**Consequence:**
- New per-consumer key NOT needed for MVP; reuses `OPENROUTER_API_KEY_RAG` budget.
- If post-launch acceptance rate (PRD KPI ≥70%) under-performs, swap model via env var
  without code change. Fallback candidate: `claude-haiku-hermes`.
- Every suggestion MUST carry a citation URL (per PRD FR19); this requirement is
  model-agnostic and lives in the interface contract.

**Gate clearance 2026-05-06** (`m2-wrap-up`): the rag-proxy (Wave 1.8) is deployed on
the production VPS and the corpus (USDA FoodData Central + EU Reglamento 1169/2011 +
Escoffier Project Gutenberg) is ingested into LightRAG. The 50-ingredient eval gate is
deferred to a post-launch monitoring slice — operationally the iron rule already
guarantees no un-cited suggestion ships to the chef, and the chef's accept/reject
pattern in the `ai_suggestions` audit table provides the live signal. Production flag
`OPENTRATTOS_AI_YIELD_SUGGESTIONS_ENABLED=true` is documented in
`apps/api/.env.example`. See `docs/operations/m2-prod-runbook.md`.

---

## ADR-019: Label generation via @react-pdf/renderer

**Decision:** EU 1169/2011 labels render via `@react-pdf/renderer` — the React-based
PDF library — using shared shadcn-ish components (`AllergenBadge`, `MacroPanel`,
`IngredientList`, `LabelPreview`) that render identically in Storybook (designer review)
and in the PDF output (production).

**Rationale:** Same React tech stack as the UI; designers preview labels in Storybook
just like any other component (per the new UX track v0.5.0 spec from `ai-playbook`).
Performance is adequate for kitchen scale (~1 label/sec ≪ requirement). Article 21
emphasis (bold) is trivially supported.

**Consequence:**
- New package `packages/label-renderer` with React PDF components.
- Labels live alongside other UI components in Storybook (per UX track Component Library
  Curation pattern).
- **Fallback path documented**: if `@react-pdf/renderer`'s CSS limitations bite (some
  flexbox quirks reported by users), swap to Puppeteer / headless Chrome rendering an
  HTML template. The component-based approach (AllergenBadge etc.) survives the swap.

**Risk (pre-launch):** EU 1169/2011 compliance is jurisdiction-specific. Ship behind
`OPENTRATTOS_LABELS_PROD_ENABLED=false` until external legal review confirms the
generated label format meets compliance for the target jurisdiction(s).

**Gate clearance 2026-05-06** (`m2-wrap-up`): external legal review filed and approved
for Spain/EU jurisdiction. Production flag `OPENTRATTOS_LABELS_PROD_ENABLED=true` is
documented in `apps/api/.env.example`. The legal clearance covers Spain/EU only —
operators deploying to other jurisdictions must repeat the review before flipping the
flag in those environments. See `docs/operations/m2-prod-runbook.md` (per-jurisdiction
reminder section).

---

## ADR-020: Frontend stack — Vite + React 18 + TanStack Query + Tailwind 4 + Storybook 8

**Decision:** `apps/web/` is a Vite + React 18 SPA with TanStack Query 5, React Router 6, Tailwind 4, and shadcn-style primitives. `packages/ui-kit/` exports components as a workspace package with Storybook 8 (`@storybook/react-vite` framework) for static review. Storybook publishes to GitHub Pages on every push to `master` per ai-playbook ux-track.md §13.

**Rationale:**
- ADR-019 already locked React + Storybook + shadcn-ish. ADR-013 (Agent-Ready) makes the API the contract — no SSR required.
- Vite cold-start <1 s + sub-second HMR is the right shape for the kitchen-tablet developer feedback loop.
- TanStack Query's stale-while-revalidate semantics give the chef sub-200 ms refetch on cost / margin reads (NFR Performance).
- Tailwind 4 `@theme` block consumes OKLCH CSS variables directly from `packages/ui-kit/src/tokens.css` — no `tailwind.config.js` to keep in sync with `docs/ux/DESIGN.md`.
- shadcn copy-and-own (per ai-playbook §13) keeps Radix versioning in our control without a runtime dep on `@shadcn/ui`.
- One npm-workspaces monorepo with hoisting (verified with `@nestjs/event-emitter` migration in M2-followups) keeps lockfile + CI install times sane.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Next.js 15 App Router**: rejected — SSR not needed, App Router learning cost adds slice budget for negligible benefit on private kitchen surfaces.
- **Remix / TanStack Start**: rejected — same SSR footprint as Next.js with worse Storybook integration as of 2026-05.
- **Astro with React islands**: rejected — misaligned with rich-interactive-surface UX (every kitchen screen is interactive).
- **Tailwind 3 + generated theme.json**: rejected in favour of Tailwind 4's `@theme` for tighter DESIGN.md ↔ runtime coupling. Documented fallback path in `m2-ui-foundation/design.md` Q1.
- **Material UI / Ant Design / Vanilla extract**: rejected — clash with the OKLCH-canonical token language or duplicate work shadcn already did.
- **SWR / RTK Query**: rejected — SWR weaker on mutations; RTK Query forces Redux.

**Consequence:**
- New `apps/web/` workspace + expanded `packages/ui-kit/` workspace.
- New `.github/workflows/storybook.yml` builds Storybook on every PR (advisory) + deploys to GitHub Pages on `master`. URL: `https://wizarck.github.io/openTrattOS/storybook/`.
- Per-component file layout codified in `packages/ui-kit/README.md` (one folder per component: tsx + stories + test + types + index).
- OKLCH-canonical CSS variables in `packages/ui-kit/src/tokens.css`; hex in `docs/ux/DESIGN.md` YAML frontmatter is a derivation snapshot only.
- Dev-time CORS handled by Vite proxy (`/api/*` → `http://localhost:3000`); production hits the real API URL via `VITE_API_URL`.

**Open follow-ups (filed in retro):**
- Tailwind 4 GA tracking (currently stable as of 2026-05, but watch for breaking changes through next minor).
- Codegen for backend DTOs → ui-kit types (manual hand-keeping today; risks drift).
- Per-PR Storybook previews via Chromatic / Vercel — deferred; Pages-on-master is sufficient for v0.

---

## ADR-021: Operational corpus is USDA + EU 1169/2011 + Escoffier (Gutenberg); modern cookbooks deferred

**Decision:** The AI yield/waste suggestion corpus ingested into the openTrattOS RAG store comprises:
- **USDA FoodData Central** (Foundation + SR Legacy datasets) — public domain (US Government Work, 17 U.S.C. §105).
- **EU Reglamento (UE) Nº 1169/2011** consolidated text — free reuse under Commission Decision 2011/833/EU.
- **Escoffier *Le Guide Culinaire*** Project Gutenberg edition — public domain (>100 years post mortem auctoris).
- **CIAA Spain materials** — gated behind explicit written permission (`CIAA_PERMISSION_GRANTED=true` env flag); script committed but inert until permission obtained.

Modern copyrighted cookbooks (Larousse Gastronomique, *The Professional Chef* CIA, *On Food and Cooking* McGee) are **explicitly out of scope** and filed in follow-up slice `m2-ai-yield-cookbooks-modern` pending publisher licensing agreements.

**Rationale:** ADR-018 mandates the iron rule (no suggestion without a verifiable citation). The audit trail — `ai_suggestions.citation_url` + `snippet` per Wave 1.7 — must be defensible if regulators or auditors ever ask "where did this 65% yield come from?". Ingesting copyrighted material without a positive permission record breaks that defensibility regardless of how internal the use feels. Escoffier 1903 is tagged `era=historical` so the LLM is told to prefer modern sources for modern technique queries; it is included for free-cost coverage of fundamental classical techniques (sauces, stocks, basic preparations).

**Consequence:**
- `tools/rag-corpus/` ingestion package with one script per source, each tagging chunks with canonical source URL as metadata so the LLM can cite back via `user_prompt` schema.
- `LICENSE_NOTE.md` enumerates upstream licenses and the explicit list of out-of-scope copyrighted works.
- CIAA script is committed but inert until permission. Re-running with the env flag set proceeds (with placeholder logic) so the corpus structure can evolve when permission lands.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Ingest cookbooks "best-effort" with disclaimer**: rejected — the iron rule's audit trail demands a positive permission record, not a disclaimer.
- **Skip Escoffier**: rejected — public domain coverage of classical technique is too valuable to leave on the table; the historical tag mitigates style drift.
- **Brave-only, no corpus**: rejected — Brave is a fallback, not a substitute. The corpus gives stable, deterministic citations for common cases; Brave handles the long tail.

---

## ADR-022: rag-proxy as stateless Python service in front of LightRAG (no LightRAG modification)

**Decision:** Translation between LightRAG's prose+references response shape and openTrattOS's canonical `{value, citationUrl, snippet}` AI suggestion contract lives in a separate Python FastAPI service (`tools/rag-proxy/`) sitting in front of an unmodified LightRAG deployment on the VPS. The proxy is stateless — every audit/cache row stays in `apps/api`'s `ai_suggestions` table per Wave 1.7.

The proxy is responsible for:
- Bearer auth from `apps/api` (`Authorization: Bearer <RAG_PROXY_API_KEY>`).
- `user_prompt` JSON-only schema injection into LightRAG queries.
- One retry on parse failure with a stricter prompt.
- Brave Search fallback (per ADR-023) when LightRAG returns no parseable result.
- Iron-rule preflight (mirrored from `apps/api/src/ai-suggestions/application/types.ts::applyIronRule`) before responding.
- Translation to LightRAG's `X-API-Key` auth scheme internally.

`apps/api/`'s `GptOssRagProvider` already speaks the canonical contract; no TypeScript code changes — only `OPENTRATTOS_AI_RAG_BASE_URL` flips at deploy time.

**Rationale:**
- **No LightRAG fork or upstream PR dependency.** LightRAG's response shape, auth, and storage stay vanilla.
- **Python is the right place for LLM-prose-parsing and HTTP I/O against arbitrary search APIs.** Pulling that into the TypeScript monorepo would couple `apps/api` to LightRAG specifics and increase ESM/CJS surface area for no benefit.
- **Stateless proxy → simple ops.** Restart safe; no migrations; no per-org access control needed because `apps/api` authenticates per-org *upstream* of the proxy and the corpus is non-PII scientific data.
- **Pluggable per `AI_SUGGESTION_PROVIDER` DI token.** Future providers (Claude Haiku, Hermes, alternative RAG engines) drop in at the apps/api layer; the proxy is one of N possible backends.

**Consequence:**
- New Docker image `opentrattos/rag-proxy`, ~250 LOC Python, deployed alongside LightRAG on the VPS.
- ADR-018's "single feature flag controls the surface" still holds: `OPENTRATTOS_AI_YIELD_SUGGESTIONS_ENABLED` is the master switch; the proxy URL is a config detail.
- Operational rollback: stop the proxy container → `apps/api` falls back to "manual entry only" via the existing iron-rule null path.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **`LightRagProvider` class inside `apps/api`**: rejected — pulls Brave HTTP + LLM-prose-parsing into TypeScript; couples `apps/api` to LightRAG's response shape; Python tooling for this work is more mature.
- **Modify LightRAG (response shape, auth, structured outputs)**: rejected per user constraint and to avoid upstream PR/fork maintenance burden.
- **Deploy rag-proxy as a Node service inside the Turborepo monorepo**: considered, but FastAPI + httpx + respx for testing is the simpler stack for this use case, and the proxy lives close to LightRAG operationally anyway.

---

## ADR-023: Brave Search fallback with hostname whitelist + daily budget; off by default

**Decision:** The rag-proxy's `BRAVE_ENABLED` defaults to `false`. When enabled by the operator, Brave Search is invoked only when LightRAG returns no parseable result after one retry. Results are filtered against a configurable hostname whitelist of authoritative domains; non-whitelisted results are dropped. A per-UTC-day query counter enforces a soft budget (`BRAVE_DAILY_BUDGET`, default 1000); over budget the proxy short-circuits to `null` without an API call.

Default whitelist: `fdc.nal.usda.gov`, `eur-lex.europa.eu`, `efsa.europa.eu`, `fda.gov`, `who.int`, `fao.org`, `ciaa.es`, `en.wikipedia.org`, `es.wikipedia.org` (subdomain-suffix matching).

Value extraction from a Brave snippet uses a small downstream LightRAG call with a focused prompt: "given this snippet, return `{value: <0-1>}`". If extraction fails, returns `null`.

**Rationale:**
- **Iron rule (ADR-018) extends to web search.** A Reddit thread or recipe content farm is not a citation. Whitelisting at the hostname level enforces source authority before the iron rule even fires on the structured fields.
- **Default-off is conservative.** First production rollout proves the corpus path; Brave is a follow-on operator decision once corpus coverage is measured.
- **Daily budget protects against runaway cost.** Brave's free tier is 2000 queries/month; the default budget keeps usage well inside even if a hot loop hits.
- **Per-result post-LLM critique would double cost without measurable quality gain** vs. a pre-vetted whitelist.

**Consequence:**
- Operators must explicitly opt in via `BRAVE_ENABLED=true` and supply `BRAVE_API_KEY`.
- Whitelist is env-configurable (`BRAVE_DOMAIN_WHITELIST`) so trusted sources can be added without redeploying — but the default is intentionally narrow.

**Alternatives considered:**

## ADR-024: LightRAG → canonical contract response mapping via user_prompt JSON schema; ignore references[] for citationUrl

**Decision:** The rag-proxy injects a JSON-only `user_prompt` instructing the LightRAG-backed LLM to respond with `{"value": <0-1>, "citationUrl": <string>, "snippet": <string>}`. The proxy parses this LLM-emitted JSON to derive the canonical contract fields. The proxy **does not** use `LightRagResponse.references[].file_path` as `citationUrl` — those are local corpus paths, not verifiable URLs.

The `citationUrl` is what the LLM committed to in its structured output. The corpus ingestion scripts (ADR-021) stamp every chunk with a canonical source URL as metadata so the LLM has the URL to cite. This forms the bridge: ingestion stamps URL → retrieval surfaces it via context → LLM cites it via `user_prompt` schema.

If the LLM's response cannot be parsed as JSON after one retry (with a stricter prompt), the proxy falls through to the Brave fallback (per ADR-023). If both paths fail, the proxy returns `null` — `apps/api` honours its existing iron-rule contract and surfaces "manual entry only" to the chef.

**Rationale:**
- **Citation must be what the LLM committed to**, not what the retrieval layer happens to surface. Otherwise the LLM could cite source-A content while paying lip service to source-B's URL.
- **`user_prompt` is the only LightRAG hook that doesn't require modification.** ADR-022 forbids LightRAG modification; structured outputs (response_format / tools) would require it.
- **Acceptable failure mode (~5–10%).** When the LLM ignores the schema, the proxy retries once. If still bad → Brave → null. The chef sees "manual entry" — same UX as Wave 1.7's `OPENTRATTOS_AI_YIELD_SUGGESTIONS_ENABLED=false` path. Acceptable per FR19.

**Consequence:**
- Corpus ingestion includes `[source_url=… era=… source=…]` metadata header on every chunk so the LLM has it as context.
- If reliability becomes a problem in production, follow-up slice `m2-ai-yield-structured-outputs` patches LightRAG's LLM call layer to pass `response_format` through to the underlying model API. That slice is intentionally deferred until measured failure rate justifies the patch maintenance burden.
- Failure-mode telemetry (LightRAG miss / Brave fallback / null) is logged structured-JSON in the proxy so operators can monitor the ratio.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Use `references[0].file_path` as citationUrl**: rejected — leaks internal corpus paths, isn't a URL the chef can open.
- **Patch LightRAG for structured outputs (response_format)**: rejected for this slice; filed as `m2-ai-yield-structured-outputs` follow-up.
- **Train a fine-tuned model on the schema**: rejected — operational complexity dwarfs the marginal reliability gain at this scale.

# Audit-log subsystem ADRs (added 2026-05-07 post-Wave-1.13 saga)

Three ADRs codify the audit-log architecture that emerged across Waves 1.9–1.13. Prior slices' `design.md` files carried slice-local ADRs (`ADR-AUDIT-SCHEMA`, `ADR-AUDIT-WRITER`, etc.); these promote the cross-slice patterns to canonical project-level ADRs. The forensic-split decision (ADR-026) ships alongside the slice that implements it (`m2-audit-log-forensic-split`).

## ADR-025: audit_log canonical architecture (single subscriber + envelope + polymorphic FK)

**Decision:** The `audit_log` table (introduced in Wave 1.9 `m2-audit-log`, migration `0017_audit_log.ts`) is the **single canonical source of truth** for cross-BC event-history persistence. Bounded contexts emit typed events on `EventEmitter2` channels; a single `AuditLogSubscriber` (`apps/api/src/audit-log/application/audit-log.subscriber.ts`) listens on every channel and persists one `audit_log` row per event. Services do not import `AuditLogService` directly; they emit, the subscriber writes.

The persistence shape is governed by the `AuditEventEnvelope<TBefore, TAfter>` interface. The envelope is the same shape for envelope-shaped channels (AI suggestions, cost rebuild, agent forensic) and the translation target for legacy ad-hoc payload channels (`cost.*` + `agent.action-executed` lean).

**Rules enforced:**

- **Two-name pattern** — bus channel name preserves module ownership for routing (`cost.ingredient-override-changed`, `agent.action-executed`); persisted `event_type` is the public, module-agnostic enum (`INGREDIENT_OVERRIDE_CHANGED`, `AGENT_ACTION_EXECUTED`). The bridge lives in `audit-log/application/types.ts::AuditEventTypeName`. New event types follow this pattern: bus channel = `<bc>.<verb>` kebab-case, persisted = `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- **Open-enum `event_type` text column** — Postgres `text NOT NULL CHECK (length 1..100)` rather than an enum. Adding a new event type is `+1 constant + 1 @OnEvent handler`; zero migrations. Trade-off: typo resistance is app-side only (TypeScript constants), not DB-enforced.
- **Polymorphic `aggregate_id` (UUID-typed)** — references entities across multiple tables (recipes, ingredients, ai_suggestions, supplier_items, organizations, agent_chat_session). No foreign-key constraint because the column spans tables. App-level guarantee: emitter only fires AFTER the entity exists. The column is **UUID-typed at the DB level** — non-UUID identifiers (free-form session ids, composite keys) MUST be UUID-shaped at emission (use `randomUUID()`) and stored opaquely in `payload_after`. Streaming endpoints with opaque session ids hit this constraint; ADR-027 codifies the workaround.
- **Hybrid translation** — new event types publish the canonical `AuditEventEnvelope` shape directly (`AI_SUGGESTION_ACCEPTED`, `RECIPE_COST_REBUILT`, `AGENT_ACTION_FORENSIC` per ADR-026); legacy ad-hoc payload events (`INGREDIENT_OVERRIDE_CHANGED`, `RECIPE_ALLERGENS_OVERRIDE_CHANGED`, `RECIPE_SOURCE_OVERRIDE_CHANGED`, `RECIPE_INGREDIENT_UPDATED`, `SUPPLIER_PRICE_UPDATED`, `AGENT_ACTION_EXECUTED` lean) get translated per-type inside the subscriber's handler before persistence. New code MUST emit the envelope shape; legacy translators are scoped to remain until `m2-audit-log-emitter-migration` ships.
- **Subscriber failure mode** — every handler is wrapped in try/catch. A DB or translation failure is logged + dropped; the emitter is never notified. Fire-and-forget bus semantics: services finish their writes regardless of audit success. Worst case is one missing audit row, surfaced for ops via structured-JSON log line. DLQ (`m2-audit-log-dlq`) is filed but volume-driven.
- **`hasTable` / `hasColumn` guards on backfill** — every audit-log-related migration's backfill SELECTs are guarded for fresh-schema safety so `0017` + `0018` + `0019` + `0022` (and any future addition) run cleanly on empty databases.

**Rationale:** Wave 1.9 demonstrated that funnelling 9 event channels into one subscriber decouples audit from business logic. Adding a new event type is a 1-line `@OnEvent` + a constants entry — zero migrations, zero service-code changes. The polymorphic `aggregate_id` keeps the table single rather than per-aggregate; the cost is the loss of a real FK, paid for by an app-level invariant. Wave 1.10 reinforced the pattern by retiring `recipe_cost_history` (a per-BC audit table); Wave 1.11 layered FTS over the same table; Wave 1.12 layered streaming CSV export; Wave 1.13 added 3 emit sites (write capabilities, chat, forensic). The architecture absorbed each addition without schema churn.

**Consequence:**

- New audit event types in M3+ HACCP, inventory, batches add a 1-line constant + 1-line handler. The table shape is fixed.
- Reverse engineering "what changed" for any aggregate is one query: `SELECT * FROM audit_log WHERE aggregate_type = $1 AND aggregate_id = $2 ORDER BY created_at DESC`.
- Querying across BCs by event_type or actor is one query. RBAC at the controller (`Owner+Manager`) gates per-org scope.
- The `m2-audit-log-emitter-migration` follow-up (move 5 cost.* legacy translators to envelope-shape emitters) is real M3+ tech-debt; deferred because it touches 5 BCs + several `@OnEvent` consumers.

**Alternatives considered:**

- Per-BC audit tables — rejected; the Wave 1.9 backfill from 5 prior BCs (ai_suggestions / recipe_cost_history / ingredients.overrides / recipes.aggregated_allergens_override) demonstrated the pattern was already drifting; consolidation was overdue.
- Postgres enum for `event_type` — rejected; M3+ adds many event types; each enum extension is a migration.
- Per-aggregate-type audit tables — rejected; queries spanning aggregates would need UNION ALL across N tables.
- Real foreign-key constraint on `aggregate_id` — rejected; would require N tables × N FKs and break the polymorphic pattern.

## ADR-026: Forensic agent-event split (`AGENT_ACTION_EXECUTED` vs `AGENT_ACTION_FORENSIC`)

**Decision:** Split the `AGENT_ACTION_EXECUTED` channel into two distinct event types:

- **`AGENT_ACTION_EXECUTED`** (channel name unchanged: `agent.action-executed`) carries the **lean, request-anchored** attribution row emitted by `AgentAuditMiddleware` (`apps/api/src/shared/middleware/agent-audit.middleware.ts`) for every agent-flagged HTTP request. `aggregate_type = 'organization'`. `payload_after = {capabilityName, timestamp}`.
- **`AGENT_ACTION_FORENSIC`** (NEW channel name `agent.action-forensic`, NEW persisted event_type `AGENT_ACTION_FORENSIC`) carries the **rich, aggregate-anchored** mutation row emitted by `BeforeAfterAuditInterceptor` (`apps/api/src/shared/interceptors/before-after-audit.interceptor.ts`) for REST writes and by `AgentChatService` (`apps/api/src/agent-chat/application/agent-chat.service.ts`) for chat turns. `aggregate_type ∈ {recipe, menu_item, ingredient, supplier, supplier_item, agent_chat_session, ...}`. Payload: full `AuditEventEnvelope` with `payload_before` + `payload_after`.

The runtime-shape discrimination via `isRichAuditEnvelope()` in `AuditLogSubscriber.onAgentActionExecuted()` is **deleted**. The subscriber gains a new `@OnEvent(AGENT_ACTION_FORENSIC)` handler that calls `persistEnvelope()` directly. Type-system-level enforcement replaces runtime-shape sniffing.

A backfill migration (`0022_audit_log_forensic_split`) reassigns historical rich rows: `UPDATE audit_log SET event_type = 'AGENT_ACTION_FORENSIC' WHERE event_type = 'AGENT_ACTION_EXECUTED' AND aggregate_type != 'organization'`. The `down()` migration reverses. No schema change is required (the column is open-enum text per ADR-025).

**Rationale:**

- Three call sites — `AgentAuditMiddleware` (lean), `BeforeAfterAuditInterceptor` (rich), `AgentChatService` (rich) — were emitting on one channel. The subscriber's `isRichAuditEnvelope()` discrimination kept things working but obscured the contract: a TypeScript reader staring at `EventEmitter2.emit(AGENT_ACTION_EXECUTED, payload)` cannot tell whether the payload is the lean shape or the rich envelope without reading the subscriber. Compile-time clarity beats runtime sniffing.
- The 3a + 3b retros both filed the split as M3+ tech-debt. Three call sites is the right pressure point to act.
- Open-enum text column means zero schema cost; the only DB-side work is the backfill UPDATE.

**Consequence:**

- Operators with existing dashboards/queries on `event_type='AGENT_ACTION_EXECUTED'` see only lean rows after the migration runs. To recover the previous (mixed) result set, they add `OR event_type='AGENT_ACTION_FORENSIC'`. Documented in `docs/operations/audit-log-runbook.md`.
- `BeforeAfterAuditInterceptor` and `AgentChatService` emit on the new channel; the audit envelope shape is unchanged.
- `AuditLogSubscriber` gains one handler, loses one helper (`isRichAuditEnvelope`).
- Future agent emit sites in M3+ (e.g. agent-issued bulk imports) emit on `AGENT_ACTION_FORENSIC` for any aggregate-anchored mutation, on `AGENT_ACTION_EXECUTED` for request-attribution rows.

**Alternatives considered:**

- Rename `AGENT_ACTION_EXECUTED` → `AGENT_REQUEST_RECEIVED` for cleaner semantics on the lean channel — rejected because it would break any historical operator query/dashboard. The lean event keeps its identity; only the rich emissions move.
- Keep the dual-shape channel and harden `isRichAuditEnvelope()` — rejected; type-system clarity is the whole point.
- Backfill optional, leave historical rows mixed — rejected; the runbook would have to document a "consider both event_type values when querying historical agent rows" caveat in perpetuity.

## ADR-027: Streaming-handler audit pattern (`@Sse()` and `Readable.from(asyncIterable)` handlers)

**Decision:** Streaming endpoints (NestJS `@Sse()` handlers, `Readable.from(asyncIterable)` HTTP responses, any handler that returns an `Observable` whose downstream consumer emits multiple events) **do not use `BeforeAfterAuditInterceptor`**. Instead the service emits its own audit row from the Observable's terminal callback (success / 5xx / transport error / unsubscribe), guarded by an `auditEmitted` flag so re-entrant termination paths can't double-emit.

The shared `BeforeAfterAuditInterceptor` is a **write-RPC primitive** — it expects exactly one terminal value from the handler's Observable, unwraps the `WriteResponseDto<T>` envelope to capture `payload_after`, and emits the audit event once. For an `@Sse()` handler, `mergeMap`-over-events would emit one audit row per token frame; that is wrong by intent (one row per turn is the correct semantic). For a `Readable.from(asyncIterable)` CSV export, the same incompatibility applies.

Streaming-handler audit emissions follow these rules:

1. **Emit the rich envelope on `AGENT_ACTION_FORENSIC`** (post-ADR-026) when the handler's terminal callback fires.
2. **Use `randomUUID()` for `aggregate_id`** — the audit_log column is UUID-typed (per ADR-025); opaque/free-form session ids stored unmodified will fail the schema constraint silently in unit tests (mocks accept strings) and explosively in INT against real Postgres.
3. **Store the opaque session id in `payload_after.sessionId`** (or analogous opaque key) for forensic linkage. Operators can search FTS or filter `payload_after->>'sessionId'` to recover the streaming turn from an audit row.
4. **Set `auditEmitted = true` in a closure-captured local before persistence**, so any subsequent terminal callback (e.g. unsubscribe after success) cannot double-emit.
5. **Emit via `EventEmitter2.emitAsync`** (not `emit`) when an INT spec immediately reads `audit_log` after the response — the `@OnEvent` handler is async and the synchronous `emit()` returns before the DB INSERT. The emit-vs-emitAsync read-after-write hazard has been hit twice (Wave 1.11 FTS + Wave 1.13 [3a]) and is a recurring footgun; the pattern must use `emitAsync` for INT-spec correctness.

Reference implementation: `apps/api/src/agent-chat/application/agent-chat.service.ts` (Wave 1.13 [3b]).

**Rationale:**

- The Wave 1.13 [3b] retro discovered all five rules in succession through CI failures. The interceptor's `mergeMap` model assumes one terminal value; SSE handlers emit many events with one terminal *event* (the `done` frame). Streaming endpoints are conceptually closer to long-running RPCs whose audit row is "the whole turn happened" rather than "one event happened".
- The UUID-typed `aggregate_id` constraint is the second-most-frequent footgun across the audit-log saga (after emit-vs-emitAsync). Codifying it here avoids a third repeat.

**Consequence:**

- Future streaming endpoints (e.g. CSV export with audit emission, batched CSV import streaming a per-row audit row, agent-issued bulk imports) follow this pattern. They do **not** add `@AuditAggregate` decorators; they wire emission into the Observable / async-iterable terminal path themselves.
- The `BeforeAfterAuditInterceptor` is unchanged. It remains the canonical primitive for write-RPC handlers (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE).
- The `auditEmitted` flag pattern is ~5 LOC per streaming service. Replicate from `agent-chat.service.ts` rather than abstract; the per-service shape varies (chat has session id; CSV export has filename; future BCs may differ).

**Alternatives considered:**

- A streaming-aware variant `StreamingAuditInterceptor` — considered; rejected for now because the per-service shape varies enough that a one-size-fits-all interceptor would either be too generic to be useful or too specific to chat. Revisit if a third streaming endpoint adopts the pattern in M3+.
- Use the lean `AGENT_ACTION_EXECUTED` for chat audit — rejected; chat is a multi-turn mutation, not a single REST request, and forensic linkage to the session id matters for compliance.
- Synchronous `emit()` even in INT specs — rejected; the read-after-write hazard re-emerges every time.
