/**
 * Surfaces final email-dispatch failures (3 retries exhausted) to the
 * Owner of the failing `organizationId` per ADR-EMAIL-FAILURE-ALERTER +
 * ADR-EMAIL-OWNER-DASHBOARD-FALLBACK.
 *
 * **Current state (slice 22 / Wave 2.1)**: the M2 `notifications`
 * bounded context does NOT exist in master yet. Until it lands (or until
 * an M3 BC fills that gap), this alerter logs at `error` level with the
 * canonical structured-log fields:
 *
 *   - `event = email_dispatch_failed`
 *   - `recipient`, `subject`, `organizationId`, `tag`
 *   - `errorCode`, `errorMessage`, `providerError`, `attempts`
 *
 * Ops monitors filter on `event=email_dispatch_failed` to surface the
 * banner contract until the M2 BC arrives. The structured-log surface
 * is forward-compatible — once `NotificationsService` exists, the
 * `alertOwner()` body grows a `notificationsService.send({...})` call
 * after the `logger.error(...)` line.
 *
 * Per ADR-EMAIL-FAILURE-ALERTER, the alerter NEVER re-throws. A double-
 * fault (e.g. notifications DB down + email send failed) is logged once
 * and swallowed; the dispatch caller already has the `failure` Result
 * envelope.
