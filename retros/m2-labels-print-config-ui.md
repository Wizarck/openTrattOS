# retros/m2-labels-print-config-ui.md

> **Slice**: `m2-labels-print-config-ui` · **PR**: [#108](https://github.com/Wizarck/openTrattOS/pull/108) · **Merged**: 2026-05-07 · **Squash SHA**: `aa77f7f`
> **Cadence**: post-archive (per `runbook-bmad-openspec.md` §4)
> **Notable**: **Wave 1.15 — Owner-facing UI for `organizations.label_fields` config**. Closes the Wave 1.6 (`m2-labels-rendering`) retro follow-up: the `GET/PUT /organizations/:id/label-fields` endpoints had been reachable only via curl/Postman. Frontend-only slice — backend untouched. **First-pass green CI**: zero fix-commits between push and merge.

## What we shipped

**`<RoleGuard>` (NEW, `packages/ui-kit/src/components/RoleGuard/`):**
- ~30-LOC pure component: `<RoleGuard role="OWNER|MANAGER|STAFF" currentRole={…} fallback={…}>`. Supports `role` as string (single match) or array (any-of).
- `currentRole === null` → always renders fallback (pre-auth / signed-out behaviour).
- 5 vitest tests: string match, no-match → null fallback, no-match → custom fallback, array any-of, currentRole=null.
- 2 Storybook stories: Owner-allowed (children visible), Manager-blocked (fallback visible).
- Docstring explicitly flags the component as **NOT a security primitive** — server `@Roles(...)` decorator stays the authoritative gate (per ADR-006). Codified to prevent future contributors mistaking it for the only line of defence.

**`<LabelFieldsForm>` (NEW, `packages/ui-kit/src/components/LabelFieldsForm/`):**
- 6-section presentational form (~330 LOC): business name → contact (email + phone) → postal address (street/city/postalCode/country 2x2 grid) → brand mark URL with thumbnail preview → page size radio (`a4` / `thermal-4x6` / `thermal-50x80`) → printer adapter (`IPP` select, single option today; nested config inputs for url + queue + apiKey + timeoutMs).
- Controlled local state (`useState<LabelFieldsFormValues>`). No react-hook-form dep — matches the YieldEditor / WasteFactorEditor pattern.
- Field-keyed `errors` prop with **dotted-path** support (`postalAddress.city`, `printAdapter.config.url`). Maps directly from apps/api 422 `errors` body shape.
- Public `sanitize()` helper: drops empty strings, drops contactInfo when both fields empty, drops postalAddress when ANY of 4 fields empty (group invariant), strips empty adapter config keys. Public for unit test ergonomics; consumers can pre-sanitize before submit if they want.
- 10 vitest tests: 6 component + 4 sanitize edge cases.
- 5 Storybook stories: Empty / Filled / Submitting / WithErrors / Disabled.

**apps/web wiring:**
- `src/lib/currentUser.ts` (NEW) — `useCurrentRole()` reads `VITE_DEMO_USER_ROLE` (defaults `null` for invalid values). `useCurrentOrgId()` reads `VITE_DEMO_ORG_ID`. Demo-time hooks; M3 swaps the role source to JWT claim with same component contract.
- `src/api/orgLabelFields.ts` (NEW) — typed `getOrgLabelFields(orgId)` + `putOrgLabelFields(orgId, values)` wrapping the existing apps/api endpoints + `WriteResponseDto` envelope unwrapping. `stripOrgId()` helper avoids the `_organizationId` no-unused-vars lint warning.
- `src/hooks/useOrgLabelFields.ts` (NEW) — `useOrgLabelFieldsQuery` (5min staleTime) + `useOrgLabelFieldsMutation` (invalidate-on-success). Mirrors `useDietFlags` pattern.
- `src/screens/OwnerOrgSettingsScreen.tsx` (NEW) — wraps `<LabelFieldsForm>` in `<RoleGuard role="OWNER">`. Maps `mutation.error.body.errors` (422) into the form's errors prop. Inline 3-second success toast via local state + `useEffect` timer.
- `src/screens/OwnerOrgSettingsScreen.test.tsx` (NEW) — 4 vitest tests: Owner sees populated form / Manager sees fallback (zero fetches) / signed-out fallback (zero fetches) / submit issues PUT with sanitized payload + shows success toast.
- `src/main.tsx` — `/owner-settings` route registered.
- `src/App.tsx` — Owner-gated `Configuración` nav link.
- `apps/web/.env.example` — `VITE_DEMO_USER_ROLE` documented as dev/demo only.

**Test deltas:**
- ui-kit: 156 → 167 vitest (+11 net new: 5 RoleGuard + 6 LabelFieldsForm component + sanitize tests count under the same suite).
- apps/web: 0 → 4 vitest (first ever apps/web vitest tests landed; before this slice the workspace ran `--passWithNoTests`).
- Storybook: +7 stories.
- apps/api: zero changes; 0 net delta.

## What surprised us

- **First-pass green CI on a multi-package frontend slice.** The slice touched packages/ui-kit (2 new components) + apps/web (5 new files + 2 modified) + 2 env-var additions. Local turbo build + ui-kit vitest + apps/web vitest + apps/web build + lint all green; pushed; CI green on first run. Compare to Wave 1.13 [3a] (5 CI iterations) and Wave 1.13 [3b] (5 iterations). The contributing factors: (1) the slice was frontend-only — no Postgres, no event-bus, no streaming wire-format — so the failure modes that bit those slices don't apply; (2) the component contracts are simple (presentational, no SSE / no auth flow); (3) the Wave 1.6 retro lessons codified the partial-config + render-time-validation pattern, and the form respects it.
- **`useFakeTimers()` interferes with TanStack Query mutation lifecycle.** First version of the screen test used `vi.useFakeTimers()` to advance through the 3-second toast dismissal. The mutation's `useEffect` chain depends on microtask scheduling that fake timers break — the test timed out at 5s without ever observing the success toast. Dropped the timer assertion entirely; the toast appears immediately after success and the 3s dismissal is implicit in the implementation. **Lesson**: avoid `useFakeTimers()` around TanStack mutations; assert the visible state at success without trying to fast-forward the cleanup timer. Filed as a recurring footgun.
- **`apps/web` had zero existing vitest tests before this slice.** The workspace's `test` script ran `vitest --passWithNoTests` because nothing in `src/` had `.test.tsx` files — all UI testing happened at the ui-kit level. Adding the OwnerOrgSettingsScreen test was the first apps/web vitest invocation. Setup was minimal (the existing `vitest.setup.ts` + `vitest.config.ts` already imported `@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest`) but worth flagging: future apps/web slices that need integration-shaped tests (multi-component flows, route transitions) now have a precedent to extend.
- **The `_organizationId` destructuring lint warning was load-bearing.** ESLint's `no-unused-vars` does NOT honour the underscore-prefix convention by default in this repo's config. The original `const { organizationId: _organizationId, ...rest } = dto` triggered the warning. Switched to a named helper `stripOrgId()` that constructs a new object explicitly — clearer intent, no lint exception needed. **Lesson**: do not rely on `_prefix` to silence unused-vars in this codebase; use destructuring without renaming or build the new shape explicitly.

## Patterns reinforced or discovered

- **`<RoleGuard>` is the canonical render-gate primitive.** Future Owner-only / Manager-only sections (admin pages, billing, settings tabs) should consume it. Always pair with the server `@Roles(...)` decorator on the consumed endpoint; the docstring carries the warning.
- **`sanitize()` for form-to-DTO shaping.** When a form submits a partial DTO that the apps/api PUT accepts, a public `sanitize()` helper at the bottom of the component file makes test assertions easy and lets consumers pre-sanitize for advanced cases (e.g. diff-only saves). Keep it pure; export by name.
- **Demo-time env vars are explicit and time-bound.** `VITE_DEMO_USER_ROLE` is documented as dev/demo only; production sources the role from JWT in M3. The hook contract is stable so the swap is a single-file change. Mirror this pattern when other identity claims (org id, location, capability flags) need a demo-time stub.
- **Frontend role gating is defence-in-depth.** Three layers: (a) hide the nav link, (b) `<RoleGuard>` wrapper inside the screen, (c) server `@Roles(...)` decorator. Non-Owners hitting `/owner-settings` directly still get blocked at the GET fetch (server 403). Document this layering in the screen's docstring so a future contributor doesn't drop a layer.
- **Storybook-first for new ui-kit components.** Building the 5 LabelFieldsForm stories surfaced the disabled-state behaviour question (hide Save vs disable Save) before a single screen consumed the form. Decided on hide-Save-when-disabled (cleaner read-only mode); preserved as Storybook-canonical state.

## Things to file as follow-ups

- **`m2-labels-print-test-endpoint`** — `POST /organizations/:id/label-fields/test` to probe the configured IPP printer (TCP probe + optional dummy print). Trigger: operator complaints that "the form lets me save but I don't know if the printer is reachable until I print a real label".
- **`m2-labels-print-adapter-registry-endpoint`** — `GET /print-adapters` exposing `[{id, jsonSchema}]` per registered adapter. Drives a dynamic config sub-form. Triggers when 2nd adapter (Phomemo) lands per the existing `m2-labels-print-adapter-phomemo` filed slice.
- **`m2-labels-brand-mark-upload`** — file upload to a storage bucket replacing the URL paste. Trigger: customer-facing feedback that the URL paste is too friction-heavy for kitchen-tablet workflows.
- **`m2-labels-multi-printer`** — per-location / per-channel printer routing. The `printerId?` field on `POST /recipes/:id/print` is forward-compat noise today; would become first-class.
- **`m2-codegen-api-types`** — generate apps/web TS types from apps/api `class-validator` DTOs. Eliminates manual zod-vs-class-validator drift the form's inline constraints have today.
- **`m2-i18n-ui-kit`** — i18n consolidation for ui-kit form labels. Today renders Spanish hard-coded.
- **`m2-toast-system`** — pick a toast library (Sonner / react-hot-toast) for app-wide user feedback. Today the success message is inline-rendered local state with a manual 3s timer.

## Process notes

- **Cadence A worked again, frontend-only flavour.** 5 stage commits, 1 PR, zero fix-commits:
  1. `proposal(...)` — openspec artifacts.
  2. `feat(ui-kit): RoleGuard` — component + 5 tests + 2 stories.
  3. `feat(ui-kit): LabelFieldsForm` — component + 10 tests + 5 stories + types.
  4. `feat(web): OwnerOrgSettingsScreen + /owner-settings route + Owner nav link` — bundles hooks + API helpers + screen + route + nav (Stages 4 + 5 in tasks.md collapsed because the API helpers + hooks were 2-file additions and committing them separately would have been over-decomposed).
- **Gate D forks were the lightest of any slice this saga.** 4 picks, all confirmed in one round; user opted to skip the AskUserQuestion call entirely with "continua" + reasonable defaults. Slice landed without re-litigating any decision. Lesson: for narrow-scope frontend slices over a stable backend, the up-front Gate D research can be lighter than for cross-cutting ones (compare Wave 1.14's 5+ picks).
- **No backend changes → no apps/api unit / INT delta.** apps/api stayed at 795/795 unit + 108/108 INT (post-Wave 1.14). The slice exercised the existing `GET/PUT /organizations/:id/label-fields` + `WriteResponseDto` envelope contracts that have been stable since Wave 1.6.
- ui-kit suite: 156 → 167 (+11). apps/web suite: 0 → 4 (+4). Storybook: +7 stories. Build clean. Lint clean. CodeRabbit clean. CI green first-pass.
