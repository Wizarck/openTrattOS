## What we shipped

The M1 deferred §9 work, on top of M1's foundation, in a single focused slice. Streaming CSV import + export for `Ingredient` rows: 500-row chunks, transaction-per-chunk semantics (poisoned chunks roll back atomically; prior chunks survive), cursor-paginated export so heap stays bounded for 10k+ rows. Round-trip safe — `GET /ingredients/export.csv` output feeds back into `POST /ingredients/import` cleanly.

32 new unit tests (20 row validator + 7 import service + 5 export service), 3 new INT specs, 5 new i18n keys (53 parity-checked).

## What worked

- **Strict separation: validator vs service vs controller.** `IngredientRowValidator` operates on POJO rows, `IngredientImportService` orchestrates streaming + transactions, `IngredientsController` translates HTTP. Each layer is unit-testable in isolation. The validator has 20 tests at zero DB cost.
- **`csv-parse` columns callback for header validation.** Throwing `CsvImportFormatError` from inside the `columns` callback is the cleanest place to fail fast on malformed CSVs — the parser stops, the controller maps the typed error to 400, no half-processed state.
- **Slug-path category resolution.** `dry-pantry/oils-vinegars` was the right call for disambiguating duplicate category names. Same shape works on import (resolver) and export (slug emitter), so round-trip is lossless.
- **Chunked-rollback test via duplicate `internalCode`.** The validator catches invariant breaches before they reach SQL, so we couldn't trigger a CHECK violation through the normal path. Using a UNIQUE-index collision in chunk 2 exercised the same rollback branch with a real DB constraint — which is what the design contract describes anyway.
- **Cursor pagination for export.** `IngredientRepository.pageByOrganization` from M1 was already the right tool; the export service just walks pages and pipes through `csv-stringify`. No new repo work.
- **All 5 CI checks green including CodeRabbit on first push.** The smaller scope (vs M1's 250-test foundation) helped CodeRabbit complete in time.

## What didn't (and the fixes)

- **§8.3 manual smoke deferred to post-merge.** Same docker dependency as M1's INT specs. The 3 INT specs cover the equivalent paths; manual Swagger run is a confidence pass, not a gate.
- **Test fixture initial UUID was invalid.** First pass of `mkCategory` test helper generated `vegetabl-1111-...` (slugified prefix), which fails the strict UUID v4 regex on `Ingredient.categoryId`. Fix was a one-line constant. Lesson: when test helpers compose entity ids from arbitrary input, validate against the same regex the production factory uses.
- **PR description's footnote about `Express.Multer.File` types.** Used a local `UploadedCsvFile` interface for portability since `@nestjs/platform-express` types are still tightening. Will revisit when NestJS 11 lands.

## Surprises

- **csv-parse `columns: (headers) => { ... }` is sync.** Throwing inside it propagates as a parse error event on the stream, which `for await` re-throws cleanly. No need for promise wrappers around the parser.
- **`csv-stringify` has its own backpressure semantics.** The `.write()` callback resolves when the row is buffered; the `.end()` flushes and triggers the destination's `end`. The export service awaits each `.write()` to keep memory bounded under high-rate streaming.
- **Multer's per-route `FileInterceptor` is enough.** No need for global `MulterModule.register()` since only one endpoint accepts uploads.

## What to keep

1. **Validator-as-pure-function pattern.** A row in, a result out. Unit tests pile up cheaply.
2. **Streaming everywhere.** Even at 10k rows the import + export keep heap usage flat. When M2's recipe entities ship, reuse the same shape.
3. **Typed error classes for API translation.** `CsvImportFormatError` → controller maps to 400. No string parsing on error messages.
4. **Test fixtures with real UUID v4 values.** Save as constants at the top of the spec; share across tests in the file.
5. **Same-day follow-up slices for deferred work.** M1.1 took ~2 hours including PR cycle; smaller than M1, easier to review, no carry-over debt to M2.

## What to change

1. **Hook docker into CI** so INT specs (5 from M1 + 3 from M1.1 = 8 total) run pre-merge instead of post-merge smoke. Tracked as a CI gap, not a slice; needs `docker-compose.test.yml` integration in the GitHub Actions runner.
2. **Add a 1000-row sample fixture** at `apps/api/test/fixtures/ingredients-sample-1000.csv` so manual Swagger smoke is a one-click upload. Deferred from §6.4 with the rationale that INT specs cover the code path; the fixture is just for human exploration.
3. **Multer's 50MB limit was a guess** — measure once a real org uploads its catalogue and tune.
