> **The Open Source Back-of-House (BOH) & Kitchen Traceability Operating System.**  
> Built to kill the grey, bloated ERP. Designed for modern kitchens.

openTrattOS is a modern, **AI-ready**, open-source restaurant management and food costing 
platform. It covers everything that happens **behind the kitchen door**: ingredient 
costing, recipe engineering (escandallos), supplier management, HACCP/APPCC compliance, 
and inventory operations.

---

## ✨ Why openTrattOS?

The Back-of-House software market is dominated by **closed-source, expensive SaaS** 
(Apicbase, MarketMan, tSpoonLab) and **legacy ERPs** that look like they were designed 
in 1998. Chefs deserve better.

| Problem | openTrattOS Solution |
|---|---|
| SaaS costs €90-300/month per venue | **Free & self-hosted** (AGPL-3.0) |
| ERPs are grey, bloated, confusing | **Beautiful, minimal interface** (TailwindCSS, mobile-first) |
| No open-source HACCP/APPCC tool exists | **Built-in compliance module** (checklists, lot tracking, label printing) |
| Vendor lock-in with proprietary APIs | **API-First design** (OpenAPI/Swagger, MCP-ready for AI agents) |

---

## 🧩 Modules

openTrattOS is built as a **modular monolith**. Each module is independently useful:

| Module | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **M1: Foundation** | Ingredients, categories, UoM conversions, suppliers & pricing | 🟢 In Progress |
| **M2: Food Costing** | Nested sub-recipes, yield/waste calculations, dynamic margin analysis | 🟡 Planned |
| **M3: HACCP/APPCC** | Batch tracking, traceability logs, digital checklists, label printing | 🟠 Planned |
| **M4: Operations** | Inventory counts, purchase orders, par-stock alerts, blind stock taking | 🔴 Planned |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS |
| **Backend** | NestJS, TypeScript, Domain-Driven Design (DDD) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL |
| **Cache** | Redis |
| **File Storage** | MinIO / S3 |
| **AI (optional)** | Python FastAPI microservice (invoice OCR, demand forecasting) |
| **Governance** | BMAD-METHOD (Discovery) + OpenSpec (Implementation) |
| **Monorepo** | Turborepo |
